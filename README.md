# Music-royalties-ai
A simulation project for music royalties, including generative AI impact

This is a personal project to explore the future of **music royalties management** with a focus on the rise of **generative AI** in the music industry.

**Career Goal:** Work as a **Financial Planning / Royalties Analyst** in the music business (major labels, publishers, or music tech).

## ðŸ“Œ Context

With the rise of tools like **Suno, OpenAI Jukebox, MusicGen**, the way music is created is changing. This project aims to:

- Simulate how royalties are calculated
- Explore how AI-generated music could impact royalty distribution
- Offer forward-thinking scenarios for future revenue models

## ðŸ§® Feature 1: Royalty Simulator

A simple Python script that:

- Takes in number of streams
- Chooses between AI or human-generated content
- Calculates estimated royalties based on standard or reduced AI rate

### Example Output:
- Streams: 1,000,000
- Content type: AI-generated
- AI Rate = $0.001 âž¤ Royalties = $1000
- Human Rate = $0.003 âž¤ Royalties = $3000


## ðŸ¤– Feature 2: AI-Generated Music & Royalties Logic

This project includes a basic logic layer that simulates royalty differences between:

- Human-created music
- AI-generated music

## ðŸ’¡ Hybrid Royalties Breakdown (Human + AI)

In this project, hybrid music tracks â€” co-created by humans and AI tools â€” are treated as shared intellectual property.

I propose the following royalty split model:
- ðŸ’µ $0.0003 per stream for the **human artist**
- ðŸ¤– $0.0001 per stream for the **AI provider** (e.g. Suno.io, Udio, Mubert, AIVA)

This approach acknowledges both creative and technological contributions, anticipating future industry practices where AI-generated elements will require monetization or licensing.

### ðŸ§ª Example

- Track: **"FusionWave"**
- Streams: `1,000,000`
- Royalty Breakdown:
  - Human Artist earns: `$300`
  - AI Company (e.g. Suno.io) earns: `$100`
  - **Total Royalties**: `$400`

As AI becomes increasingly involved in music production, fair and transparent models like this can help reshape the royalty ecosystem with clarity and fairness.

ðŸ’¡ These are **speculative models**, not legal opinions, but they highlight the real questions major labels will face in the near future.
