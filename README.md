# Music Royalties & AI Impact – Simulation Project

A forward-looking data project exploring how music royalties might evolve with the rise of generative AI. Built to position myself as a Financial Planning / Royalties Analyst in the music industry.

This is a personal project to explore the future of **music royalties management** with a focus on the rise of **generative AI** in the music industry.

**Career Goal:** Work as a **Financial Planning / Royalties Analyst** in the music business (major labels, publishers, or music tech).

## 📌 Context

With the rise of tools like **Suno, OpenAI Jukebox, MusicGen**, the way music is created is changing. This project aims to:

- Simulate how royalties are calculated
- Explore how AI-generated music could impact royalty distribution
- Offer forward-thinking scenarios for future revenue models

## 🧮 Feature 1: Royalty Simulator

A simple Python script that:

- Takes in number of streams
- Chooses between AI or human-generated content
- Calculates estimated royalties based on standard or reduced AI rate

### Example Output:
- Streams: 1,000,000
- Content type: AI-generated
- AI Rate = $0.001 ➤ Royalties = $1000
- Human Rate = $0.003 ➤ Royalties = $3000


## 🤖 Feature 2: AI-Generated Music & Royalties Logic

This project includes a basic logic layer that simulates royalty differences between:

- Human-created music
- AI-generated music

## 💡 Hybrid Royalties Breakdown (Human + AI)

In this project, hybrid music tracks — co-created by humans and AI tools — are treated as shared intellectual property.

I propose the following royalty split model:
- 💵 $0.0003 per stream for the **human artist**
- 🤖 $0.0001 per stream for the **AI provider** (e.g. Suno.io, Udio, Mubert, AIVA)

This approach acknowledges both creative and technological contributions, anticipating future industry practices where AI-generated elements will require monetization or licensing.

### 🧪 Example

- Track: **"FusionWave"**
- Streams: `1,000,000`
- Royalty Breakdown:
  - Human Artist earns: `$300`
  - AI Company (e.g. Suno.io) earns: `$100`
  - **Total Royalties**: `$400`

As AI becomes increasingly involved in music production, fair and transparent models like this can help reshape the royalty ecosystem with clarity and fairness.

💡 These are **speculative models**, not legal opinions, but they highlight the real questions major labels will face in the near future.

📊 Royalty Simulation Excel File

You can explore the royalty data simulation in this downloadable Excel file:
